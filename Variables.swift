// Introduction to variables

/* A variable is simply a name that represents a particular piece of your computer’s memory that has been set aside for you to store, retrieve, and use data */

// Basic data types

// Int, Double, String, Bool

/* Suppose we are building a game, and we want to keep track of the player’s name, the player’s score that goes from 0 to 10, the player’s level, etc. We need some variables! */

var score = 0
print(score)

var year = 2023

// Arithmetic operators

var amount = 18.50

var tip = amount * 0.2
print(tip)

// Compound Assignment Operators
var apples = 16
apples -= 4 // remain 12
apples /= 2 // remain 6

print(apples)

// Type annotation
// Type annotations begin with a colon : and end with a type.
